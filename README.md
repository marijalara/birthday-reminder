Birthday-reminder in React

Goal
The goal is to create birthday-reminder application.

npm start 

I created react app with name birthday-reminder and started my project with npm start.

I created new folder called components in that folder I created new file called App.js. In this file I used material ul for container. In that container I had header for this project and also I created Button tag. In folder components I created Button.js where I had button with className. In App.js I also created List tag and I created state. So, I created that file in components. I also created data.js file in src with all information for the people(id, name, age and image). 
In List.js I used map statement to display all this people with picture of them, names and ages.

I used all className in index.css to style it a bit.
